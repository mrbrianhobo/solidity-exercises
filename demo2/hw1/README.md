## Assignment Instructions

For the two exercises, **ex1** and **ex2**, please take a look at the specifications noted in their respective markdowns.

In **greeter.sol** you will be coding up the *Solidity* equivalent to `Hello, world!`. In **fibonacci.sol** you will be implementing the simple Fibonacci sequence. 

For syntactical quirks and more info on the language, please refer to the [*Solidity* documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).

As you (probably) do not have your developer environment set up, we recommend checking your code in the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Clicking on `Create` on the bottom-right corner should bring up fields where users can input arguements to specific functions. Clicking on that function's name should run the function and provide an output under the `Decoded:` subtitle.
